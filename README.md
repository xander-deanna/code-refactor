code-refractor - Homework assignment for 12/19/2020

------------------------------------------------------------------

This week's assignment was all about accessibility and cleanliness. 

I started this assignment by ensuring as many assets as possible where labeled with an alt or title tag describing the asset. 

From there I cleaned up the css so that there wasn't any unnecessary repeats of information. 

Then lastly I added some hyperlinks to both the header title and the copywrite at the bottom of the page to make it easier for the user to get back to the homepage.



Thanks for grading! :)
